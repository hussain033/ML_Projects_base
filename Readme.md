# My Machine Learning Practice Projects Repository

This my Machine Learning Practice Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of basic machine learning projects that I've completed to apply and reinforce my learning in the field of AI and Data Science. 

These projects are my personal projects. I have other repos which contains Machine learning projects I have done along with my friends and colleagues. 

## Projects Overview

1. **Cancer Prediction**
   - [Notebook](./Project1_Cancer_Prediction/Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb)
   - [Dataset](./Project1_Cancer_Prediction/Cancer.csv)
   - Trained a Classification model to identify whether the given data refers to the presence or absence of Brease Cancer.
    
2. **Stock Price Detection using regression**
   - [Notebook](./Project2_Stock_Price_prediction/notebook.ipynb)
   - [Dataset](./Project2_Stock_Price_prediction/TSLA.csv)
   - Built a regression model for stock price prediction, which predicts today's ending price when today's starting, maximum and minimum price is given.

3. **Credit Card Fraud Detection using Classification**
   - [Notebook](./Project3_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb)
   - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
   - Developed a Classifier which identifies whether a Credit card transaction is a fraud transaction or not.
   - Implemented this project as a part of CodeClause Data Science Internship

5. **Movie Recommendation System**
   - [Notebook](./Project3_RecommendationSystem/notebook.ipynb)
   - [Dataset](./Project3_RecommendationSystem/ratings.csv)
   - Developed a collaborative filtering recommendation system using user-item interaction data.
   - Implemented this project as a part of CodeClause Data Science Internship.
